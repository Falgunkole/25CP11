Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Real Estate Market using NLP and Machine Learning
Domain: Real Estate
Problem Statement: There is a lack of structured insight into public perception of the real estate market. Buyers, investors, and developers would benefit from sentiment-based analysis of real-time opinions to make informed decisions.
Abstract: In the dynamic real estate market, understanding public sentiment toward properties, locations, and developers is essential for informed decision-making. This project presents a sentiment analysis framework tailored to the real estate domain, utilizing user-generated reviews collected online forums, and property platforms. This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual data related to the real estate domain. We propose the development of a system that can classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights into market perceptions. The system utilizes text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings, and classification models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and deep learning approaches. A labeled dataset of real estate-related text will be curated to train and evaluate the models. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score will be used for validation. Additionally, visualization tools and a dashboard offer stakeholders real-time insights into property perceptions across different cities and tiers. This approach not only aids buyers and sellers in gauging public opinion but also supports developers and policymakers in making data-driven decisions. 

Objectives:
●	To collect a diverse and relevant textual dataset from various real estate sources, such Real estate websites like 99acres and MagicBricks.
●	To apply NLP techniques to clean, preprocess, and extract meaningful features from the collected text data.
●	To perform sentiment classification on real estate-related content using machine learning models, deep learning models
●	To evaluate the model’s performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
●	To build a simple, user-friendly interface/dashboard where users can input real estate-related text and get sentiment results in real-time.
